# Verilog-Design-and-Simulation-of-MUX-Based-Logic-and-JK-Synchronous-Counter
– Developed and simulated a 2-to-1 Verilog MUX, and expanded it to a 2n-to-1 MUX for Boolean functions involving
up to 5 variables.
– Created a Clock-Enabled JK Flip-Flop in Verilog and used it to construct a four-bit synchronous binary counter.
